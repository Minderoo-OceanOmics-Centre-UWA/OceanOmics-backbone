# OceanOmics 'super tree'

For visualisation purposes we need a large tree that contains all marine vertebrates. For subsequent publications, presentations, 
visualisations etc. we can then always 'just' subset that large tree.

This repository contains code that pulls in several public trees, 
merges the two Actinopterygii trees into a supertree, adds bird, reptile, mammal, and shark trees to the root of that tree,
and then treats that large tree as a backbone to insert, at the genus-level, species we do not have in the phylogeny but are marine vertebrates.
This is done using the [RRphylo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RRphylo/vignettes/Tree-Manipulation.html) package.

![Intermediate tree](tree_without_families_added.all_sources.png){ width=50% }

Thre are some rogue 'sharks' in there but they are at the root of the tree with a few other fishes.


For species for which we do not have a genus in the backbone tree, the above method does not place them.
But we have the families! so what we do is calculate the MRCA of all members of the family and place the species at the root of that tree with the maximum branch length.

# Caveats

- The branch lengths in the merged tree are meaningless as the contributing trees do things differently.

- The marine vertebrates not in the tree are placed into their genus (see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RRphylo/vignettes/Tree-Manipulation.html) for the method),
so their placement is a bit random within the genus, and obviously their branch length is extra-meaningless. The ones added via the family MRCA alone are even iffier.

# Files

*Master Species List - Marine Vertebrates.xlsx* - an OceanOmics-internal curated list of marine vertebrate species. We place all of these in the phylogeny.


*big_tree.Actinopterygii.Chondrichtyes.tre* - all trees (see below) merged into a supertree using superTree MRP. Of the three trees in this repository, this is the most 'trustworthy' one. This tree has 10,938 tips.


*big_tree.Actinopterygii.both.withGeneraAdded.tre*  - supertree of fish, all other trees bound, with missing species added to their respective genera.

*big_tree.withGeneraAdded.andFamilies.tre* - the above tree, but with missing species without genera in the tree added at family-level MRCA for species that were not in the tree.
Of the three trees, this is the least 'trustworthy' one. This tree has 34,916 tips.

*big_tree.withGeneraAdded.andFamilies.hierarchical.tre* - all trees (see below) merged using a hierarchical MRCA approach. 
If the species has congenerics in the same genus, place at MRCA of the genus. If the speces has no species in the same genus, 
but others in the same family, place at MRCA of the family. If there's only one species in the genus OR one other species in the family, 
place next to that species. This tree looks more accurate than *big_tree.withGeneraAdded.andFamilies.tre*, which has many species at strange roots.


*.Renviron* - this changes the download SSL package to use openSSL to work with our internal VPN.

Other files ending in *tre - all public phylogenies from the below papers.

*mergeTrees.qmd* - the quarto report with all code.

## Files we may not need


*big_tree.Actinopterygii.Chondrichtyes.tre* - all trees merged into a supertree using superTree MRP. DO NOT USE. This resulted in some rogue placements that would need manual fixing.


You can see that some of these species were added at the root of the entire tree:
![Tree with added species](tree_with_families_added.png)


*big_tree.withGeneraAdded.tre* - the above tree with as many marine vertebrates added as possible using [RRphylo tree.merger](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RRphylo/vignettes/Tree-Manipulation.html).
Where Genus was not present in the tree, the species was not added. This tree has 31,277 tips. DO NOT USE.

*big_tree.withGeneraAdded.andFamilies.tre* - the above tree, but with missing species without genera in the tree added at family-level MRCA for species that were not in the tree.
Of the three trees, this is the least 'trustworthy' one. This tree has 34,916 tips. DO NOT USE.

# To subset

```
# load the tree
t_big <- ape::read.tree("big_tree.withGeneraAdded.andFamilies.tre")

# make sure your list of species has _ in their names instead of spaces
your_list_of_species <- gsub(' ', '_', all_species)

# check which of those species are in the tree
species_in_tree <- intersect(species_to_keep, t_big$tip.label)

# and subset the tree
t2 <- ape::keep.tip(t_big, species_in_tree)

# and plot!
ggtree(t2)
```
